# OEvis

Actually we wanted to build a *semantic* bookmarking application. However, it ended in a *modest* bookmarking application.

## Intensions

With more time, or a better plan, this application should realize the following features:

- A better UI :)
- Taking Open Graph meta data to create relations between  bookmarks automagically.
- Scrape links of websites you just bookmarked and check if those were already bookmarked and create a relationship between those.
- Check for RDFa data in bookmarked websites. Use it to create relationships to existing bookmarks as well.
- Display the relations to bookmarks. Of course.
- Tagging
- Better managing/editing possibilities of bookmarks.

All in all this should create a graph of interconnected bookmarks that helps to find stuff easier than just utilizing tagging.
